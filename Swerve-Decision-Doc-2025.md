# Swerve Decision Doc 2025
Document to decide on whether we should use YAGSL or CTRE Swerve

| Codebase    | FOC   | Taylor experience | Rec. By YAGSL Creator |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| YAGSL       | Maybe | Yes               | [Yes](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/yagsl-2025-a-leap-forward-in-swerve-drive-control-and-simulation/476005/21) |
| CTRE SWERVE | Yes   | No                |                       |

Terms:
FOC: Field oriented control, changes how the motors behave, probably increasing motor torque and power consumption.
